# BTP-R180 Java Library
A java library to print on the BTP-R180 thermal printer

This project has been put together by reverse enginering my thermal printer commands, and looking at other ESCPOS libraries for PHP and Java.

This project is VERY WIP, has very little documentation, and may break your printer.
